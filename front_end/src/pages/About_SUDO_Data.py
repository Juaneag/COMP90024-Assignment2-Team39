## SD Home and Community Care Program 2012-2013
#### db name: sudo
The Home and Community Care (HACC) Program is a joint Commonwealth, State and Territory initiative. It funds services which support people who are frail, aged and younger people with a disability (and their carers), who live at home and whose capacity for independent living is at risk or who are at risk of premature or inappropriate admission to long-term residential care. The broad aim is to offer maintenance and support services to help frail older people and younger people with disabilities to continue living in their communities. HACC services may be offered in the home or local community by an HACC agency, community health centre or local council. Services include centre-based and other respite, social support and counselling, personal care, home modification and maintenance, transport, meals and other food services, information, advocacy and assessment, support for carers, allied health services, domestic assistance and community nursing. Data are presented by SD for 2012 and 2013.
